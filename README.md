# 2D-Box-packing-in-circle

Hlo guys ! 
This is a project which is used for calculating and displaying the number of possible boxes of given size that can be packed inside a given circle
I made this using python language and modules that I used are pygame, math, sys and Tkinter module.
These modules must be installed in your IDE for the proper working this project.
You can simply install these modules one by one by typing "pip install xyz" in command bar, where xyz is module name, which you want to install.
For eexample if you want to install 'pygame' you have to write "pip install pygame" in the command bar.
